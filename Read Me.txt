This Unity project is a simple example of the possibilies of camera mechanics in Unity


The script 'Click' is where all the screenshot logic is held

The Post Processing Effects and Physical Camera on the Camera gameobject
are put there to show how you can manipulate simple post processing effects, 
as well as camera components, to simulate how a camera operates.

I know this is super simple stuff but I figured it could help people make more
camera centric games. Enjoy!
